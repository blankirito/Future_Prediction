# Future Prection

A machine learning project that predicts potential future popular movie titles based on historical data and metadata.  
The goal is to practice regression/classification modeling, feature engineering, and trend analysis in a real-world scenario.

## Learning Outcomes
- Applied data collection and preprocessing techniques on movie datasets  
- Practiced feature engineering  
- Trained and evaluated predictive models for popularity score  

## Features
- Input: movie metadata (title, genre, release year, cast/crew, budget, etc.)  
- Output: predicted popularity score or hit/miss classification  
- Preprocessing pipeline: data cleaning, feature encoding 
- Model training with algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, K-Neighbprs Classifier, SVC
- Evaluation using metrics

## Technology Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy 
- scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn 
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation, Python scripts for reproducibility 

## Future Improvement
- Expand dataset with social media and search trends for better prediction accuracy  
- Experiment with deep learning models (RNN, Transformers) for sequential trend forecasting  
- Deploy model as a web service using Flask/FastAPI  
- Add visualization dashboard for predicted vs. actual performance  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script  
3. Test with sample movie metadata
